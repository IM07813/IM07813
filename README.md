# Waqar (IM07813) - Aspiring AI Developer 👨‍💻🤖

## About Me

👋 Hi, I'm Waqar, an AI enthusiast with a keen interest in Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I love tackling new challenges and am deeply committed to the AI community. My projects, which you can find on my GitHub, reflect my dedication to learning and growing within this dynamic field.

## My Expertise

![Python](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python)&nbsp;
![TensorFlow](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=tensorflow)&nbsp;
![PyTorch](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=pytorch)&nbsp;
![Scikit-Learn](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=scikitlearn)&nbsp;
![OpenCV](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=opencv)&nbsp;
![Reinforcement Learning](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ai)&nbsp;
![Computer Vision](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=opencv)&nbsp;

I am proficient in multi frameworks for machine learning/deep learning that is creating, training, fine-tuning and deploying models, and actively working with the ChatGPT API to finetune it for a specific task. I've also fine-tuned models like Meta's LLaMA and Google BERT for various applications. My interest in Reinforcement Learning has recently been focused on Deep Reinforcement Learning backed up with neuroevolution of augmented topology and the future of both together solving the problem of hyper-parameter tuning.

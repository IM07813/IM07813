# Hi there, I'm Waqar (IM07813) 👋

I am an aspiring developer with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence. I have a diverse range of interests within the field, including Python development, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## My Projects 🚀

Over time, I have successfully completed several projects which can be found on my GitHub account. These projects showcase my growing expertise and commitment to advancing my knowledge in AI-related technologies. Presently, I am dedicating my time to developing new Machine Learning projects on a daily basis, further enhancing my skill set.

Some of my recent projects are:

- [Sentiment Analysis with BERT](https://github.com/WaqarIM07813/Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT) 😊
- [Image Captioning with CNN and LSTM](https://github.com/WaqarIM07813/Image-Captioning-with-CNN-and-LSTM) 📷
- [Chat-bot to answer physics related questions](https://github.com/WaqarIM07813/project_3) 📝
- [Image classification using CNN](https://github.com/WaqarIM07813/project_2) 😷
- [Data analysis using different supervised algoritms](https://github.com/WaqarIM07813/project_1) 🎥

## My Goals 🎯

In pursuit of expanding my horizons, I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities on projects involving Machine Learning, NLP, and Deep Learning. If you are interested in working together or have any inquiries, please feel free to reach me at freespirited07813@gmail.com.
